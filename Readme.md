Hey ,this is my next mini project.A decentralised Kind of Youtube!

TODO:

1. Do the frontend
2. WE would be able to get the video in bits using the filereader API
3. From there, we can use IPFS and pinata to upload and pin it
4. THis should call for a function in the smart contract
5. It stores this videos info and emits an event
6. We store the hash in an array and use it to get back the video

Tools needed:

1. For the frontend , we will go with react and material ui.
2. We will need the pinata sdk
3. For the backend , we will go with hardhat and ethersjs
